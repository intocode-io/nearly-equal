## A function to compare Float without worry about something like 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3

### Installation
1. Install in your project
    ```
    npm i @intocode-io/nearly-equal
    ```
2. Import the code

    ```
    import nearlyEqual from '@intocode-io/nearly-equal';
    ```
    Or
    ```
    const nearlyEqual = require('@intocode-io/nearly-equal');
    ```


### Usage
#### Problem
The problem occurs when you try to compare Float variables
```
0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 // false
```
Because 0.1 + 0.2 in many programming language including JavaScript is 0.30000000000000004
```
0.1 + 0.2 // 0.30000000000000004
```
#### Solution
`nearlyEqual` can help you
```
nearlyEqual(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3); // true
```
